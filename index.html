                <p>After me I dragged six lengths of leather from an equal number of my warriors. These lengths we had
                    previously fastend together and passing one end to the topmost warrior I
                    lowered the other end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the avenue below. No one
                    was
                    in sight, so lowering myself to the end of my leather strap, I dropped
                    the remaining thirty feet to the pavement below.

                <p>In this way, with ten warriors, I built a series of three steps from the ground to the shoulders of
                    the
                    topmost man. Then starting from a short distance behind
                    them I ran swiftly up from one tier to the next and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of
                    the
                    highest I clutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself

                <p>The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows the lush meadows beyond Pyrford and the
                    hedges
                    on either side were sweet and happy with multitudes of dog roses.
                    The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as
                    it
                    begin, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead without
                    misadventure about nine o'clock and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with my cousins
                    and
                    commended my wide to their care.
